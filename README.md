# FairShare

## Split Bills with Friends

The days of manually dividing your group's tip at dinner is over.

With FairShare, the person that foots the bill takes a picture of the receipt. Fairshare identifies the bill items, intelligently filling in missing details and improving legiblity. Users invited to a bill can swipe right on their items and pay the owner their share of the bill, with tax and tip automatically divided evenly amongst everyone.
